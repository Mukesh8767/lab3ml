Lab: Logistic Regression for Binary Classification
This repository contains the code and explanations for implementing a logistic regression model for binary classification. The lab demonstrates how to apply the logistic regression model to a real-world dataset and evaluate its performance using various metrics.

Objectives
Understand and implement logistic regression for binary classification problems.
Apply the logistic regression model to a real-world dataset and evaluate its performance.
Tasks
Task 1: Understanding Logistic Regression
Learn the key concepts behind logistic regression and how it differs from linear regression.
Understand the sigmoid function and how it maps input values to probabilities.
Define the cost function for logistic regression and explore its optimization using gradient descent.
Task 4: Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics
Train the logistic regression model using the training data.
Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Visualize the results using plots like the ROC curve and the precision-recall curve.
Make predictions on new test data and interpret the output probabilities.
